# Moderator Agreement
In order to access the moderator functions, our volunteer community moderators must review and accept the moderator agreement, below. If the agreement changes, existing moderators will be required to accept the new terms to maintain their access.

## The terms of the agreement
I acknowledge and agree that as a volunteer moderator on toot.wales and/or sites and services operated by Toot Wales, Inc.:

 - I will abide by the current Code of Conduct (which is a part of this agreement), and enforce it to the best of my ability.
 - I will abide by the Privacy Policy.
 - I will abide by all other officially announced moderator and user policies made available to me.
 - I will accept additional guidance given by members of the Toot Wales staff team, whether in response to questions, concerns or discussions regarding existing policies.

I acknowledge that I have access to additional personally-identifying information about Toot Wales users as a moderator. Some of this information may be subject to GDPR and other privacy rules. In connection with my access to and/or use of Moderator-privileged personally identifying information:

 - I will use such information solely in accordance with the terms of this moderator agreement and other policies, instructions and procedures Toot Wales, Inc. provides to moderators.
 - I will not disclose or share this information with anyone that is not a moderator or employee of Toot Wales, Inc.
 - I will not store or copy this information for any reason other than communications with other moderators or employees of Toot Wales, Inc.
 - I will only use such information in connection with performance as a moderator and for the benefit of Toot Wales, Inc.
 - I grant permission to Toot Wales, Inc. to contact me about moderator-relevant content during my tenure as a moderator.
 - I acknowledge and agree that I am an independent volunteer moderator for one or more sites operated by Toot Wales, Inc. and I am not an employee, agent or representative of Toot Wales, Inc., and I have no authority to bind Toot Wales, Inc. in any manner and I am solely responsible for my statements and actions. I attest that my statements and posts do not represent the views, opinions or actions of Toot Wales, Inc.

Toot Wales, Inc. reserves the right to suspend or terminate my privileges as a moderator at any time without warning in the event Toot Wales, Inc. determines I have violated any of these terms. Whenever possible, moderator removal will follow Toot Wales, Inc.â€™s moderator removal processes. I will be informed via written communication of the specific reason that I have been terminated. I have the option to appeal termination.

Toot Wales, Inc. agrees that it will:
 - Respect your privacy.
 - Obtain your explicit written permission before commenting to any media or independent reporters about you or your moderator actions.
